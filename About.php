          <p class="lead">Our story started in 1897. A hundred years ago, we were devoted to animal issues involving stockyards and slaughterhouses. In 1972, the City of Seattle and
            King County established their own animal control divisions,
            and we moved to Bellevue. Since then, weâ€™ve been a private nonprofit dedicated to saving and serving pets in need.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">What sets us apart </h2>
          <p class="lead">Seattle Humane is a managed-intake shelter. This means we accept animals by appointment to provide the best care. When pets are brought to us requiring medical attention,
            our veterinary team works hard to save their lives. If an adopted pet requires training to
            thrive in his or her new home, we provide it. We strive to give animals the care they deserve for as long as it takes us to find them a loving home.</p>
